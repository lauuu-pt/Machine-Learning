In this project, we worked as data science consultants for a **retail company**, developing a **prediction model** to help the **Marketing Department** identify which customers are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign. Using data from a **previous campaign**, we analyzed customer behavior and characteristics to build a model capable of predicting future responses. The goal was to enable the company to **increase campaign efficiency**, **maximize customer engagement**, and **reduce marketing costs** by targeting the right audience with data-driven precision.
