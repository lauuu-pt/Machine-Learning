In this project, we acted as data science consultants for **Hotel H** in Lisbon, aiming to create a **data-driven customer segmentation model**. Using the hotelâ€™s customer database, we analyzed **geographic, demographic, and behavioral characteristics** to identify distinct customer groups. This new segmentation helps the marketing department **target customers more effectively**, optimize **pricing and promotions**, and improve overall **marketing strategy**.
