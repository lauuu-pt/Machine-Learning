In this project, we worked as data science consultants for a **bike rental company**, aiming to develop a **predictive model** that estimates the **total number of bike rentals for the following day**, with predictions made daily at **15:00**. Using historical rental data, we explored and processed relevant features such as **weather conditions, time variables, and seasonal trends** to improve forecast accuracy. The goal of the project was to help the company **optimize staff allocation** and **adjust its daily marketing budget** on social media, enabling more efficient operations and data-driven decision-making.
